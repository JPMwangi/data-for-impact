# data-for-impact

**A growing toolkit and workflow for turning local datasets into data-driven narratives that matter.**

This repository documents an evolving process of working with public data sourcesâ€”especially from Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) and other local government or institutional reportsâ€”and transforming them into structured, understandable insights that support better thinking and decision-making.

Itâ€™s built for data professionals, policy thinkers, and anyone curious about making *local data useful again*.

## Why this project exists

We often talk about using data for impact. But local dataâ€”messy, unstructured, buried in PDFs or Excel sheetsâ€”is often ignored or underused.

This repo shows that:
- It is possible to **extract, clean, and narrate** real-world insights from local data.
- We can build a **transparent, repeatable workflow**â€”from raw tables to stories that help people make better decisions.
- Using data from our own contexts is a **form of self-determination and relevance**.

This is not a one-off demo. Itâ€™s a living, working process. It evolves with every dataset, every challenge, and every insight shared.

## Who this is for

- **Data professionals** looking to practice with real, local datasets and apply reproducible thinking.
- **Decision makers and collaborators** who want to follow a clear trail from numbers to meaning.
- **Educators, researchers, and civic builders** trying to reconnect data work to the public good.

## When and how to use this

- When youâ€™re working on **projects involving public reports, government data, or development metrics**.
- When you want to **go beyond dashboards or PDFs** to discover what the data actually says.
- When you need a **clear process** to move from raw inputs to actionable insights or publication-ready content.

Each project here walks through an actual dataset and shows the decisions behind each stepâ€”not just the code, but the thinking.
